            Version control helps to save snapshots or versions of a project,
            allowing a project to easily be restored to a past point if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other collaborators can create snapshots of their own to work on the
            project alongside you, but working on their own version
            (fork/branch) to ensure that they are not disturbing your version of
            the project.
          </li>
          <li>Common Git Commands:</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>
            git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it
