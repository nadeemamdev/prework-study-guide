      <section class="card" id="html-section">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can think of HTML as the structure or foundation of a house.
            HTML is the first step to building a great webpage!
          </li>
          <li>
            The head element contains information (or metadata) about the
            webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Metadata is information about data. It's stored in the &lt;head&gt;
            and is used by the Browser, Search Engines and other developers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inside the body you add other HTML elements. You should aim to use
            semantic HTML elements wherever possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Semantic HTML elements describe their role on the page, making the
            overall webpage more accessible.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Returning to the analogy of building a house, CSS can be thought of
            as the design/decor of the house.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can add CSS to a webpage in 3 ways: in-line CSS; internal
            stylesheet; external stylesheet. An external stylesheet is
            preferred.
          </li>
          <li>
            You declare CSS rules via a (selector { property: value; }) combo.
          </li>
          <li>
            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="JavaScript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Last but not least is JavaScript which adds behaviour/functionality
            to a webpage. Using the house anaology from earlier, think of it as
            making the doors open and blinds open/close. Most webpages would be
            super boring if not for JavaScript!
          </li>
          <li>
            A variable is a container/binding that stores items. Using the name
            of a variable you can easily refer to the data stored inside.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript makes the webpage come to life through interactivity and
            dynamic behaviour!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Git is a version control system with a purpose to make software
            development easier.
          </li>
          <li>
            Version control helps to save snapshots or versions of a project,
            allowing a project to easily be restored to a past point if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other collaborators can create snapshots of their own to work on the
            project alongside you, but working on their own and other
            developers.
          </li>
          <li>
            git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to
            it.
          </li>
        </ul>
